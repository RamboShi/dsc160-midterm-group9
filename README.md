## Abstract

(10 points) 

Rooted in our group members' common interest in watching animation movies, and after revision of Professor's comments, we decided to take this Midterm Project as an opportunity to explore critically the intersection between digital films (animations) and the arts. 
Movie photos or movie screenshots are one of the very first impressions movie viewers have on each film. Often times, qualities of these images would directly influence viewers' decision on whether to proceed with watching or whether to turn to other options. Inspired by this understanding, our group hopes to compare two of the greatest animation production bases: America and Japan's animation movie photos, for studies on how Western and Eastern animation movies differ in their illustration approaches. In particular, we would be looking at two of the most prominent animation studios from the two nations -- Walt Disney Animation Studios (America) and Studio Ghibli (Japan) -- and inspect how image statistics from their movie productions differ.

The world-famous Walt Disnet Animation Studios has produced countless number of celebrated animated feature films including:
- Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
- Pinocchio
- Frozen

The noteable Studio Ghibli, on the other hand, has produced many award-winning animation films, as well as many of the most highest-grossing anime films worldwide. These include:
- Castle in the Sky
- Spirited Away
- Howl's Moving Castle

Derived from our group members' background understanding on the two production studios' animes, our hypotheses are based on these workshops' movie images, and are formulated as followed:
1. Hypothesis1
2. Hypothesis2
3. Hypothesis3

Besides primary image features discussed above, we would also look into reflecting movie images' feature statistics on each movie's "Plot Keywords." Most mentioned plot keywords would be illustrated by word-clouds with colors associated to results of image processing. Building upon topics covered in class, our analyses would be primarily based on Python. We are expecting to deploy popular image-processing libraries including skimage, OpenCV, Pillow along with Bokeh for interactive visualizations. Results would later be presented in a variety of forms including images and graphs for summary of significant findings, word-clouds for displays of plot keywords results, and interactive charts enabled for better understandings of our project.  

## Data

(10 points) 

This section will describe your data and its origins. Each item should contain a name of the data source, a link to the source, and any necessary background information such as:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- [Data Scraping](code/scrape-image.ipynb): ipynb file for data acquisition and scraping
- analysis
- [Modelling](code/modelling.ipynb): ipynb file for feature engineering, model fitting, and model evaluation
- [Data Visualization](code/visualization.ipynb): ipynb file for data visualization 

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

#### Modelling:
- In an attempt to classify Disney's movie photos from those of Ghibli's, several classification models -- including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors -- were trained and tested on our image dataset.
- Our best classification result is based on a Support Vector Machine with a highest accuracy score of 0.818. While this result can not be referenced as particularly high, we do believe there is a high probability it might be due to our lack of training data. With more training instances, we are confident in seeing a possibly higher classification accuracy score. Disregarding of this limitation, a score of 0.818 does tell us that there are discernable and un-ignorable differences in terms of image stats between the famous Western Animation studio and the prominent Eastern Studio Gilbli.
- Each model are fitted to a GridSearch with numerous hyperparamters for tuning, as well as a 5-fold cross validation to address the problem of overfitting. Results are then selected as the best accuracy_score among each model's 5 produced score.
- Not very surprising, Support Vector Machine (SVM) won the first place in terms of classification, with a highest accuracy score of 0.818. However, what we found surprising is a SVM model with a hyperparamter set of an 'rbf' kernel, and gamma of 'scale', produced equally high accuracy_score as a linear SVC with penalty term of l2. This says that a Support Vector Machine with two different kernel functions gave exactly the same result, which we believe is pretty rare to see.
- Except for the few classifiers that gave unreasonable outcomes (e.g. K-Nearest Neighbors with )

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
